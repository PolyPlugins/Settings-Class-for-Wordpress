# WordPress Settings Class
Our goal was to create a class that could easily be imported into projects to give easy methods to handle adding a settings to the backend of WordPress.

**Features**
- Bootstrap Container (Courtesy of [Rush Frisby](https://rushfrisby.com/using-bootstrap-in-wordpress-admin-panel))
- Font-Awesome Field Info Buttons and Bootstrap Toasts
- jQuery Dynamic Navigation
- Settings Grouped Under One Option in Database (Saved as Multi-Dimensional Array)


**To-Do**
- Currently only 2 field types are supported, but as we are actively developing software using this class, we will be adding the additional field types soon.
- Menu Location Parameters


**Consider Contributing**
We know this class will be useful to many in cutting down development times, but we would love help from the community. We are actively using this class for our software and will continue to build off of it, but we know it can become something greater, faster, with the help of the community. Feel free to submit a PR or submit any issues you have as we will be actively maintaining this.
